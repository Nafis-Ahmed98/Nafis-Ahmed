- ğŸ‘‹ Hi, Iâ€™m Nafis Ahmed.
- ğŸ‘€ Iâ€™m interested in applying my knowledge and practical experience in machine learning and data analysis to the real-world outside of my projects.
- ğŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently finishing up my third year as a Data Science and Analytics student equipped with both theoretical and practical knowledge of data science applications. Recently   learned advanced machine learning and text mining applications involving sci-kit learn and NLTK, I've expressed quite the interest in these topics and hope to expand my knowledge beyond the projects I have done so far.
